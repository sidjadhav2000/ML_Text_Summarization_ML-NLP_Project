# Text_Summarization_ML-NLP_Project
Developed a comprehensive text summarization web application utilizing the Hugging Face API, specifically employing the BART model. This project enabled me to deepen my understanding of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) features. Key aspects of the project include:
Backend Development: Built using Flask for efficient web application development.
Local Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication.
Feedback Section: Included a feature for user feedback to continuously improve the service.
User Interaction: Users can input text or paragraphs and specify the desired summary length (min & max).
Language Support: Supports summarization in both English and French.
File Upload: Users can upload .txt and .doc files for summary generation.
